-- check crime scene reports to get clues
SELECT * FROM "crime_scene_reports" WHERE "month" = '7' AND "day" = '28' AND "street" LIKE 'Chamberlin Street'
-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse. Interviews were conducted today
-- with three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.


SELECT * FROM "interviews" WHERE "month" = '7' AND "day" = '28' AND "transcript" LIKE '%courthouse%'
--Ruth: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away.
--      If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot
--      in that time frame.

--Eugene: I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse,
--        I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

--Raymond: As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
--         I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked
--         the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
